## 🎯 Create Issues

You can create [Issues](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues "MASVS Issues") first for missing requirements, content or errors so that it can be discussed **before** creating a PR.

- In order to avoid conflicts that several people are working on the same issue without knowing it, the issue will be assigned to one or more people by the project leaders.
- Explain what you think is missing in the issue, including references (if available) and give a suggestion as to where it could be added.

## 📝 Open a Pull Request

Open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/pulls) with your changes.

- Your PR may be merged after review. Be sure to follow our [style guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/style_guide.md "MSTG Style Guide") when writing content.
- A PR is the preferred way for small modifications such as correcting typos.

## ✅ Become a Reviewer

You can [Review Pull Requests (PRs)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/pulls) and also gain contributions. If you are a fluent speaker in any of the different languages that the MASVS is available in, feel free to give feedback on any of the submitted PRs.

After your PR or issue has been submitted, we will review it as quickly as possible which typically only takes a few days. If you think we have forgotten about it, feel free to give us a nudge after 7 days have passed.

> Be sure to use GitHub "Suggested Changes". This saves you as a reviewer and the PR author a lot of time. And you get *points* (attributions) for the changes that you suggested (if the author commits them you become a co-author of those commits). If you're constant with your reviewer work you can apply to be recognize as an official reviewer in our Acknowledgements page.

## 🔎 Proof-reading

If you do proof-reading, these are the things we’re looking for:

- Content [cohesion & coherence](https://writing.chalmers.se/chalmers-writing-guide/writing-a-text/coherence-cohesion/)
  - is there a good linkage of ideas?
  - does the paragraph make sense?
  - does it make sense with the next one? think that hundreds of people have written in here, often without considering the surroundings of the text they were including).
- Reducing the content to a minimum (people tend to be very verbose/wordy) and in such a document we need clear and short/concise statements
- Optimize for scannability (maybe instead of a big paragraph it would be better to have a bullet point list).
- Any passive voice sentences? Convert to active voice.
- Does each paragraph focus on a single topic?
- Are key points stated at the start of each section?
- Are commas, parentheses, colons, em-dashes, and semicolons used properly?

## 🌐 Translating the MASVS

Translating the MASVS in a new language is another great way to contribute. This helps the project to reach to more people around the world.

Before starting a translation please consider the following:

- **First of all** contact us on Slack or via email.
- We need a second translator who can verify that the English version of the MASVS has been translated properly.
- Once you are all set, go to your fork and follow [these steps](4_Add_new_Language.md) and create a Pull Request once finished.

> Note that after your translation, we will ask your help to translate any changes as well, so your language can remain up to date. Otherwise we can only create a one-time-release.

## 🚫 What not to do

Although we greatly appreciate any and all contributions to the project, there are a few things that you should take into consideration:

- The document should not be used as a platform for advertisement of commercial tools, companies or individuals. Write-ups should be written with free and open-source tools in mind and commercial tools are typically not accepted, unless as a reference in the security tools section.
- Unnecessary self-promotion of tools or blog posts is frowned upon. If you have a relation with on of the URLs or tools you are referencing, please state so in the PR so that we can verify that the reference is in line with the rest of the guide.

Please be sure to take a careful look at our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md "Code of Conduct") for all the details.
